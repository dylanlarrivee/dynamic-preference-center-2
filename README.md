# Dynamic Preference Center Pages

This is a preference center and unsubscribe form page that I built out for a client to gather email marketing preferences and allow the customer to unsubscribe from marketing emails if they chose to. This was built out using HTML, CSS, Javascript and meant to be used in the Selligent Marketing Platform.

User data is captured in the forms and then saved to the database in Selligent to be used by the marketing team in the future.
